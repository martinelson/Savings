# Savings and Loan App

## Purpose
This projects help the user determine an appropriate savings plan for an item they want to purchase. The user inputs the following items:

- Cash income per month
- Necessary expenses per month
- Amount already saved up
- How much savings they want left over
- Estimated budget for goal
- When user would like to purchase item

Based on this input, the application gives a recommendation on if they have enough saved up, if they can reasonably save up in time, or if they need to push out the time of purchase out further. 

As well as the savings goal, the application also has a loan payment calculator that calculates the interest on loan payments. 

This project was created with React and served on a node.js / express backend on Heroku.

The project is hosted on Heroku at the following URL: https://aqueous-spire-64056.herokuapp.com/

It is hosted on a free tier so it may take a moment for the application to wake up.

## Context
Financial literacy is an important skill that is often delayed until adulthood. Developing ways to help build up this skill via software is important to expand access to people of all ages. With this in mind, I decided to use this idea as a guide for this application when practicing my React development.
